# Kusama

Kusama is an R&D (risk & danger ðŸ˜‰) network for Polkadot experiments. It is designed to be as close as possible to the Polkadot mainnet conditions to serve as an accurate proving ground.

One of its goals is to provide a realistic blockchain for the community to test the cryptoeconomic security of Polkadot mechanics. It is important that the Polkadot network is as secure as possible, so Kusama is the dangerous, risky, and insecure network that will help to troubleshoot Polkadot. Kusama is very experimental so donâ€™t expect any guarantees -- it is completely feasible that someone will break it.
